My Project Report: String Encryption/Decryption

I built a simple tool to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers. The hardest part was handling spaces and special characters while making sure decryption worked correctly. This project helped me understand encryption better and improve input handling.
